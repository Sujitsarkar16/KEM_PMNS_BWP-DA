## 📊 Executive Summary

### Critical Findings
- **High LBW Rate**: 36.7% of births are low birthweight (2.4x WHO threshold of 15%)
- **Gender Disparity**: Female babies at 41.0% vs male babies at 33.4% LBW rate
- **Socioeconomic Determinants**: Electricity access is the strongest protective factor
- **Data Quality**: 99.6% dictionary match rate ensures high reliability

### Key Risk Factors Identified
1. **Electricity Access** (p=0.0169) - Strongest protective factor
2. **Maternal Gravidity** (p=0.0208) - Higher gravidity associated with better outcomes
3. **Living Female Children** (p=0.0246) - More female children associated with higher birthweight
4. **Maternal Parity** (p=0.0292) - Higher parity associated with better outcomes
5. **Two-wheeler Ownership** (p=0.0391) - Transportation access protective

## 📈 Key Findings and Insights

### 1. **Public Health Crisis**
The 36.7% low birthweight rate represents a significant public health concern, being 2.4 times higher than the WHO threshold of 15%. This finding indicates an urgent need for comprehensive intervention strategies.

### 2. **Socioeconomic Determinants**
Electricity access emerged as the strongest protective factor against low birthweight, highlighting the critical role of infrastructure development in maternal and child health outcomes.

### 3. **Nutritional Status Concerns**
Analysis revealed widespread undernutrition:
- **Pre-pregnancy BMI**: 17.97 (underweight category)
- **Vitamin B12**: 194.66 ng/mL (low)
- **Folate**: 13.53 ng/mL (deficient)
- **Hemoglobin**: 14.75 g/dL (borderline normal)

### 4. **Gender Disparities**
Female babies showed significantly higher risk of low birthweight (41.0% vs 33.4%), indicating gender-based health inequities that require targeted intervention.

### 5. **Reproductive Health Patterns**
Higher gravidity and parity were associated with better birthweight outcomes, suggesting that maternal experience may be protective and first-time mothers need additional support.
