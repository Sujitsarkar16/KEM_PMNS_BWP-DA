# Step 3: Outcome Variable Engineering Analysis

## üìã Overview

**What is Outcome Variable Engineering?**
Outcome variable engineering is the process of creating, validating, and preparing the "target" variables that we want to predict or analyze. In our case, we're focusing on birthweight and creating derived variables like "Low Birthweight" flags. Think of it as preparing the "answers" we want to find in our data analysis.

## üéØ Why Was This Step Performed?

### 1. **Define Research Targets**
- **Problem**: We need to know what we're trying to predict or explain
- **Solution**: Identify and validate the main outcome variable (birthweight)
- **Benefit**: Clear research focus and measurable goals

### 2. **Create Clinically Meaningful Variables**
- **Problem**: Raw birthweight numbers are hard to interpret clinically
- **Solution**: Create categorical variables like "Low Birthweight" flag
- **Benefit**: Easier to understand and communicate results

### 3. **Enable Statistical Analysis**
- **Problem**: Need both continuous and categorical outcomes for different analyses
- **Solution**: Create multiple versions of the same outcome
- **Benefit**: Flexibility in analysis methods

### 4. **Quality Control**
- **Problem**: Need to ensure our outcome data is valid and reliable
- **Solution**: Check for extreme values and data consistency
- **Benefit**: Confidence in our results

## üîç How Was It Performed?

### Step 1: Birthweight Variable Examination
We analyzed the main birthweight variable (`f1_bw`):

```python
# Key Statistics Found:
- Total observations: 791
- Mean birthweight: 2,575.68 grams
- Standard deviation: 405.68 grams
- Range: 823.91 - 3,850.00 grams
- Missing values: 0 (all imputed)
```

### Step 2: Range Validation
We checked for biologically implausible values:
- **Extreme low (< 1000g)**: 1 case (0.1%)
- **Extreme high (> 5000g)**: 0 cases (0.0%)
- **Normal range (1000-5000g)**: 790 cases (99.9%)

### Step 3: LBW Flag Creation
We created a binary variable for Low Birthweight:
```python
# LBW Definition: Birthweight < 2500 grams
LBW_flag = 1 if birthweight < 2500 else 0
```

### Step 4: Gestational Age Assessment
We looked for variables to create SGA/LGA (Small/Large for Gestational Age):
- Found 5 gestational age variables
- Values were outside typical range (20-45 weeks)
- Could not create SGA/LGA variables at this time

### Step 5: Sex Stratification
We identified sex variable (`f1_sex`) for stratified analysis:
- Sex 1: 452 cases (57.1%)
- Sex 2: 339 cases (42.9%)

## üìä What Did We Find?

### Birthweight Distribution
```
üìà Birthweight Statistics:
- Mean: 2,575.68 grams
- Median: 2,600.00 grams
- Standard Deviation: 405.68 grams
- 25th Percentile: 2,300.00 grams
- 75th Percentile: 2,850.00 grams
```

### Low Birthweight Analysis
```
üö® LBW Flag Results:
- Total LBW cases: 290 (36.7%)
- Normal birthweight: 501 (63.3%)
- LBW rate: 36.7% (concerning - WHO threshold is 15%)
```

### Sex Differences
```
üë• Birthweight by Sex:
- Males (Sex 1): Mean = 2,599.59g, LBW rate = 33.4%
- Females (Sex 2): Mean = 2,543.79g, LBW rate = 41.0%
- Difference: Females have higher LBW rate
```

### Gestational Age Variables
```
üìÖ GA Variables Found:
- f0_m_age_eld_child: Mean = 3.34 (likely years)
- f0_m_age: Mean = 21.31 (likely years)
- f0_m_GA_V1: Mean = 121.42 (likely days)
- f0_m_GA_V2: Mean = 204.92 (likely days)
- f0_m_GA_Del: Mean = 270.56 (likely days)
```

## üîç Key Insights and Inferences

### 1. **High Low Birthweight Rate (36.7%)**
- **What it means**: More than 1 in 3 babies are born with low birthweight
- **Why it's concerning**: WHO considers >15% as high, we have 36.7%
- **Implication**: This is a significant public health issue in this population

### 2. **Sex Differences in Birthweight**
- **What it means**: Female babies are more likely to be low birthweight
- **Why it happens**: Biological differences in growth patterns
- **Implication**: Need to consider sex in all analyses

### 3. **Data Quality Issues**
- **What we found**: 1 extreme outlier (823.91g) and gestational age in wrong units
- **Why it matters**: Affects analysis validity
- **Implication**: Need data cleaning before final analysis

### 4. **Missing SGA/LGA Variables**
- **What we found**: Gestational age variables exist but in wrong units
- **Why it's important**: SGA/LGA are important clinical outcomes
- **Implication**: Need to convert gestational age to weeks for proper classification
