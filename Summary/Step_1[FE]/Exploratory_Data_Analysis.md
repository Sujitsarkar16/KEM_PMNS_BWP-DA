## üìã Overview

**What is Exploratory Data Analysis?**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of investigating and understanding data through statistical summaries, visualizations, and pattern recognition. Think of it as "getting to know your data" - like meeting someone new and learning about their characteristics, preferences, and relationships.

- **Benefit**: Clear understanding of what we're working with

### 2. **Pattern Recognition**
- **Problem**: Need to identify interesting patterns and relationships
- **Solution**: Statistical analysis and visualization of variable relationships
- **Benefit**: Discover hidden insights and data stories

### 3. **Risk Factor Identification**
